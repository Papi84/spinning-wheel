# Spinning Wheel

This project creates an interactive, colorful spinning wheel using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- A wheel divided into six colorful slices
- Continuous spinning animation
- Pause on hover
- Dynamic color change based on mouse position when hovering

## How it works

### HTML Structure
The HTML file creates a basic structure with a wheel div containing six slice divs.

### CSS Styling
The CSS file styles the wheel and its slices:
- Creates a circular shape for the wheel
- Positions and colors each slice
- Applies a continuous spinning animation

### JavaScript Functionality
The JavaScript file adds interactivity:
- Pauses the spinning animation when the mouse hovers over the wheel
- Resumes spinning when the mouse leaves the wheel
- Changes the wheel's color based on the mouse position while hovering

## Usage

To use this project, simply open the HTML file in a web browser. Hover over the wheel to pause it and move your mouse to see the color change effect.

## Customization

You can easily customize this project by:
- Changing the number of slices in the HTML and adjusting the CSS accordingly
- Modifying colors in the CSS file
- Adjusting the spin speed by changing the animation duration in the CSS
